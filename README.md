# Mojo playground

Bunch of code snippets for playing around with mojo.


## Installation

Currently I am on Fedora 39, mojo does not have official installation instructions for it, I am using [arch-mojo](https://github.com/Sharktheone/arch-mojo) script to install.

Next install `zlib-devel` to ensure building works.

```bash
sudo dnf install zlib-devel
```
